# How to Contribute

We cannot merge external pull requests into the DeepVariant repository at this
time. The source of truth for DeepVariant lives in an internal Google codebase,
and changes must first be made internally.

However, we still welcome community contributions! Please feel free to fork the
DeepVariant repository and open a pull request or issue with suggested edits. To
incorporate your contributions, we will make the changes internally and then
push them to GitHub in the subsequent release. We will attribute the changes to
you in the commit description and release notes.
